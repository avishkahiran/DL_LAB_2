1.	What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
o	increasing the number of hidden nodes can enhance a deep learning model's capacity to learn complex patterns but requires careful consideration of overfitting, computational resources, and hyperparameter tuning.

2.	Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 
o	relationship between the number of hidden nodes and accuracy is a complex interplay of factors, including overfitting, model capacity, and the specific problem being solved.
